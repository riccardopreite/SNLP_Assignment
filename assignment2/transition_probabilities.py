'''
Implement the matrix of transition probabilities.
Parameters:	from_state: string;
            to_state: string;
            internal_representation: data structure representing the parameterization of the matrix of transition probabilities;
                this data structure is returned by the function estimate_transition_probabilities
Returns: float; probability of transition from_state -> to_state

'''
Implement a function for estimating the parameters of the matrix of transition probabilities
Parameters: corpus: list returned by the function import_corpus
Returns: data structure containing the parameters of the matrix of transition probabilities;
            use this data structure for the argument internal_representation of the function transition_probabilities

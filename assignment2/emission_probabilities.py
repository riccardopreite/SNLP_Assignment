'''
Implement the matrix of emmision probabilities.
Parameters:	state: string;
            emission_symbol: string;
            internal_representation: data structure representing the parameterization of the matrix of emission probabilities;
                this data structure is returned by the function estimate_emission_probabilities
Returns: float; emission probability of the symbol emission_symbol if the current state is state

'''
Implement a function for estimating the parameters of the matrix of emission probabilities
Parameters: corpus: list returned by the function import_corpus
Returns: data structure containing the parameters of the matrix of emission probabilities;
            use this data structure for the argument internal_representation of the function emission_probabilities
